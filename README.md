# WeatherApp

First attempt at using Javascript to make a Weather App

    With this weather app you are able to search for the weather by simplying typing in the city name in the search bar and click sumbit. Doing so will provide you with the current forecast in the city you input which includes the temperature, humidity wind speed and uv index for that day. it will also provide a 5 day forecast which includes temperature and humidity. 

  ### Weather App guidelines
  
  * click inside the search bar and input the name of the city that you would like to see the forecast of.

  * Then click on the sumbit button,

  * which will run the functions to retrieve the weather data from the api's,

  * which will then create cards to display the current forecast and the 5 day forecast.
